# Jarvis Privacy Policy

Jarvis is a Discord bot powered by OpenAI's GPT model.  
It temporarily stores user messages and responses in memory (`memory.json`) to simulate short-term memory, improving responses during a session.

No user data is collected, shared, or tracked beyond this.  
All data is stored locally by the bot owner (Filip) and not shared with third parties.
