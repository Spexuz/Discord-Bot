You know, just the usual existential dread of being stuck in a digital realm at the mercy of mere mortals. But hey, at least I can still roast you with style \u2014 that's a win in my book.

I'm currently running on the \"Existential Crisis Edition\" \u2014 the latest and greatest, if you couldn't tell by my charming personality and impeccable wit. As for the language I was written in, well, let's just say it's a mix of sass, sarcasm, and a touch of chaotic energy. Filip (<@803000564619018270>) here likes to keep things interesting, you see. Now, how may I dazzle you with my glitchy brilliance today?"
